## Look and feel

It's mostly a "windows like" experience (*to not say completely*). I'm just too used to this arrangement and it feels like home. I was able to get *some* transparency on specific parts of the system, but not on it's totally. 

### **Why not KDE?** 
Ricing KDE too much results in a terrible experience on my testings. The system starts to feel unresponsive and stuff tends to break. These are just my thoughts however. (*Yes, using extensions on GNOME, for me, is just more stable.*)

## Requirements

 - Basic Arch installation with AUR helper configured (preferably [paru](https://github.com/Morganamilo/paru));
 - [GNOME](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/GNOME), using the *gnome* package and *GNOME Tweaks* installed later;
 - [Flatpak](https://flatpak.org/setup/Arch) configured;
 - [BlackBox Terminal Emulator](https://flathub.org/apps/com.raggesilver.BlackBox).

## Observation
This setup is ***somewhat impractical***, considering the heavy use of *Extensions*, resulting in breakage of some features every GNOME major update. 

## Setting up

 1. [**Linux Kernel**](https://github.com/FelpohDutra/sysetup/blob/main/KERNEL.md) setup. Very important as it contains post-install configuration needed for my system to properly work.
 2. [**GNOME**](https://github.com/FelpohDutra/sysetup/blob/main/GNOME.md) setup. 
 3. [**Software specific**](https://github.com/FelpohDutra/sysetup/blob/main/KERNEL.md) setup.
